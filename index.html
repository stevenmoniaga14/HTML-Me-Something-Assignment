            Hello there! My name is Steven Moniaga and I'm driven to achieve optimal health and living well through old age. 
            My journey towards fitness started when I signed up for a gym membership, looking forward to improve my strength and mobility after an injury. 
            Day by day I started to enjoy going to the gym and has since made it a habit to maintain and improve overall wellness after each gym session.
            Together with my passion for exercise, I'm also fascinated by the numerous benefits exercise provide for the body and mind. Here are the known facts.

            1. Exercise can make you feel happier
           </h2>
           <p>
            Exercise has been shown to improve your mood and decrease feelings of depression, anxiety, and stress.
           </p>
           <p>
            The authors of a 2019 review found that 10-30 minutes of exercise is enough to improve your mood.
            </p>
           <p>
            Exercise may increase brain to serotonin and norepinephrine. These hormones relieve feelings of depression. 
            It may also increase the production of endorphins, which help produce positive feelings and reduce the perception of pain.

            2. Exercise can increase your energy levels
           </h2>

           <p>
            Your heart pumps more blood as you move, delivering more oxygen to your working muscles. 
            With regular exercise, your heart becomes more efficient at moving oxygen into your blood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over time, exercise results in less demand on your lungs. 
            This is one of the reasons why you may find yourself getting less and less out of breath during exercise, according to the American Lung Association.

            3. Exercise can help your brain health and memory
           </h2>
            <p>
            Exercise has been shown to cause the hippocampus to grow in size, which may help improve mental function. 
            This is part of the brain that's vital for memory and learning.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regular physical activity is important in older adults because it can help slow down the physiological effects of aging in your brain. 
            It may also help reduce changes in the brain that can contribute to conditions like Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

               4.  Exercise can reduce pain
            </h2>
            <p>
               One way that exercise may help prevent or reduce chronic pain is because it increases your pain tolerance over time.
            </p>
            <p>
               Exercise may also help you control pain associated with various health conditions, including:
               <ul>
                  <li>chronic low back pain</li>
                  <li>fibromyalgia</li>
                  <li>chronic soft tissue shoulder disorder</li>
               </ul>

            <h2>Takeaway</h2>
            <p>
               Exercise offers incredible benefits that can improve nearly every aspect of your health. 
               Regular physical activity can increase the production of hormones that make you feel happier and help you sleep better.

            <p>
               Moderate-intensity aerobic activity is anything that gets your heart beating faster, like walking, cycling, or swimming. Activities like running or participating in a fitness class count for vigorous intensity.
               You can use weights, resistance bands, or your body weight to perform muscle-strengthening exercises.
